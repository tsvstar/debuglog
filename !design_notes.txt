1.a. There is no reliable approach to differentiate default (0 args) and extended (1 or more args) cases in macro.
  b. Multiple arguments of uniform initializer of ctor (which are parts of {} separated with comma) conflicted with macro arguments.
     It is possible to wrap that arg into (), but it is easy to forget.
     Plus such parenthesis brokes the only hack which was able to differ 0 from 1 args cases.

Non-standard approach to solve both problems is to separate the initializer arguments and enter message arguments into two different parenthesis scopes.
The trick used here is that preprocessor doesn't expand macroses with arguments if there are no parenthesis in instantiation place.
The only single-statement which do some action with no parenthesis is object constructing. That conflicts with ability to do stream-like operations there, so deprecate such syntax.

Also rely on that this helper is contingous part of the MACRO, use locally remembered pointer to the last constructed sentry existed for sure
